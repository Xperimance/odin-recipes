    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Believe it or not, cooking ribs with cherry cola makes for an amazing combination. Give this recipe a try and you'll see what I mean.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Dry Rub:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Wet Rub:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons yellow mustard</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons cherry cola</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Ribs and Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 rack baby back ribs, membrane removed</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups cherry cola</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons ketchup</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>salt</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>For dry rub, whisk salt, smoked paprika, onion powder, garlic powder and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>For wet rub, whisk mustard, vinegar and 2 tablespoons cherry cola together in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 250 degrees F. Line a sheet pan with a piece of foil at least 6 inches on both ends. Use large size, heavy-duty foil if possible. Place the ribs, meat side up, on the foil.</li>
        <li>Brush wet rub over top and sides and sprinkle about 60% of dry rub over the surface. Turn ribs over and brush with wet rub, then sprinkle the remaining dry rub.</li>
        <li>Center the ribs lengthwise on the foil and bring up the ends of the foil and crimp so any juices will stay inside. Crimp the two long edges together over the top of the ribs.</li>
        <li>Bake in the oven for 2 hours. Remove, open the foil and pour off juices that have accumulated in the foil into a saucepan.</li>
        <li>Turn the rack meat side up and brush with wet rub. Enclose again in the foil and continue to roast at 250 degrees F for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>While the meat is cooking, add any remaining wet rub to the juices in the saucepan, then add the 1 1/2 cups cherry cola, ketchup and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer on medium high, cook until liquid is reduced by half. Reduce heat further and simmer liquids very slowly until they thicken. Once it thickens, remove the heat completely.</li>
        <li>After 1 hour, remove the ribs from the oven and open out the foil, pressing foil flat to line the pan.</li>
        <li>Turn the oven temperature up to 300 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Brush ribs with sauce. Return ribs to the oven for 15 minutes. Repeat this process until ribs are tender and come easily off the bone.</li>
        <li>Let ribs rest for about 10 minutes. Slice between each rib with a sharp knife and serve with extra sauce.</li>
    </ol>
